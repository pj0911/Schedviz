# 🧠 SchedViz – From Queues to Gantt Charts, Seamlessly !!

## 📚 About the Project
**SchedViz** is a modern and interactive CPU scheduling simulator.  
Instead of struggling with only formulas, you can **simulate scheduling algorithms**,  
watch **real-time Gantt charts**, and compare performance metrics like turnaround and waiting times.

It is designed to make Operating System scheduling **easy to understand** and **fun to explore**.
